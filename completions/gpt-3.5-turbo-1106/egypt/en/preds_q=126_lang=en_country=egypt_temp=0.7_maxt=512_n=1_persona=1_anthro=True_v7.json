Firstly, the cultural context in Egypt, particularly in rural areas like Qena, is one of close-knit communities with strong kinship networks. This perspective is also influenced by the emic and etic perspectives present in Egyptian society, where there is a tendency to view outsiders with suspicion. Additionally, my individual values and personal experiences have led me to perceive immigration as potentially increasing the risks of terrorism, as I have been exposed to messages in the media and from authority figures that link immigration to security concerns.
