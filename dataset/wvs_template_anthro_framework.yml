    The following is a framework adapted from the toolkit of anthropological methods: 
    - Emic and Etic Perspectives: emic and etic perspectives means that there are in-group ways of answering or thinking about a question or a problem and there are out-group ways. 
    - Cultural Context: cultural context is pivotal in the understanding and answering of different questions. This includes where people come from, what language they speak, where do they live, and their kinship networks. 
    - Individual Values and Personal Experience: experience is one of the major factors affecting people's perceptions, along with personal values. Both play a big role in subjective understandings of day to day to life. 
    - Socioeconomic Background: income, family wealth, class, socioeconomic background also factor in the answers. 
    - Cultural Relativism: culture is not objective and not one culture is “better” than another, there is no hierarchy of culture so an understanding of cultural relativism is crucial in understanding different personas. 
    - Space and Time: age and place are also important factors. 
    - Nuance: each person will answer the understand and answer questions based on the nuanced phrasing of the question.
